					<h1>Theme</h1>
					<p>The car represents the interior world of Kiarostami’s characters, while the world is reflected off the glass that we stare out in pain, loneliness, confusion, or some existential crisis. The windshield can show a character’s wishes or hide their darkness inside. Many shots are layered in such a way to show how the world outside can be memories rising to the surface or even past trauma’s whose wounds have reopened and cut so very deep. It is the director’s palette in which he paints a wordless story across the safety glass encasing his principals. Many of his films make the car a central motif in a character’s climatic appraisal of his and her place in the world and with others.</p>
