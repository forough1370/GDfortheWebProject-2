					<h1>Certified Copy</h1>
					<h2>2010</h2>
					<p> Do you know Virginiana?</p>
					<p> Yeah, I've heard the name but I've never been there.</p>
					<p> Well, I have a little surprise. So you were saying... yeah, it was difficult to be simple is that it?</p>
					<p> Yeah, that's it.</p>
					<p> Yeah. well, we are not worms.right? we're not supposed to be simple and just complex beings and where's the line between simple person and simple mind? Where's the line? tell me?</p>
					<p> There isn't a simple answer</p>
					<p> Only idiots work hard in life. That's her belief. You shouldn't be around things that make problems like: gas for you is better than a real fire. Just take the switch, safer, easier. She's married to the simplest men on earth. To her, he's the best man alive. He stammers, MMMMMARIE!Him for her, it's a love song.</p>
					<p> Well, I can understand that he's lingering over her name.</p>
					<p> They got it wrong where they registered Namath birth. You know, she said the right spelling of my name is MMMMMarie.</p>
					<p> Well, she sounds amazing.</p>
					<p> Yes, she is.</p>
					<p> Something else in that book.</p>
					<p> Good!... What are you writting? What is this woman doing in the middle of the street. Look at her! She is crazy!ok... let me go...ok, so what are you writting?...It's amazing how some people think that road is their home</p>
					<p> That's right. You can read it later on</p>
					<p> Oh no. I mean, I just want to see what you wrote. is that ok? I know, I a bit nosy but just...(reading a sentence of the book) That's all I need.</p>
					<p> What do you mean?</p>
					<p> It's gonna be impossible for her to change the nonesense. Thank you very much!</p>
					<p> Just don't give it a look!</p>
