					<p>Taxi Driver:You are a journalist?</p>
					<p>Journalist:Yeah, for Soroush Magazine.</p>
					<p>TD:I took you for a cop.</p>
					<p>J:That’s funny… I heard about this case and thought it would make a good story. I’m going to see it through to the end. A story like this doesn’t come along. You might get two or three in your whole career.</p>
					<p>TD:It’s a hot news</p>
					<p>J:Sensational news - the kind that boosts sales. It’s what I call an “Oriana” story. You’ve heard of Oriana Fallaci?</p>
					<p>TD:No</p>
					<p>J:You haven’t?</p>
					<p>TD:No</p>
					<p>J:Peter Bogdanovich? John Edisson? Some of the best.</p>
					<p>TD:They’ve never been my passengers(laughing).</p>
					<p>J:That’s funny! Anyway, they’re famous journalists. Their work is well known worldwide. Especially Fallaci. She’s always on the trail of hot stories. She has a gift for finding stories no one else does. That’s why she has an international reputation. And I’m sure this is an “Oriana” story.
					I’m going out to figure out if he’s up to something fishy, like stealing from the family, If so, they should arrest him. That’s why, I need you till tonight.</p>
					<p>TD:No problem.</p>
					<p>J:You sure? Call your agency so if there’s any trouble, we’ll be in this together.</p>
					<p>TD:It’s ok. I’m not with them full-time anyway. I’m a retired fighter pilot. I’m part of the ground forces now.</p>
					<p>That could make a good story too: air forces on the ground, ground forces in the air.</p>
