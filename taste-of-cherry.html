					<h1>Taste of Cherry</h1>
					<h2>1994</h2>
					<p>Aren’t you wondering why I’ve offered you a ride?</p>
					<p>Yes.</p>
					<p>I know that your duty is to preach and guide people. But you are young, you have time, you can do that later. It’s your hands that I need. I don’t need your tongue or your mind.</p>
					<p>I’m lucky that those hand belong to a true believer. With the patience, endurance and perseverance that you learn, you’re the best person to carry out this job.</p>
					<p>You’re not telling me what I have to do.</p>
					<p>I know my decision goes against your beliefs. You believe God gives life and takes it when He sees fit. But there comes a time when a man can’t go on. He’s exhausted and can’t wait for God to act. So he decides to act himself. There, that’s what’s called “suicide”.
					You see, the word “suicide isn’t only made for dictionaries. It has to have a practical application. And here’s the application.
