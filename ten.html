					<h1>Ten</h1>
					<h2>2002</h2>
					<p>Son:Are we going to grandma's?</p>
					<p>Mother: Yes, we are.</p>
					<p>Mother: Aren't you coming to our place? It's up to you... Your aunt also told me that you want your father to get married. That you'd like him to marry again. That it could be better. Is that true? You think your father needs it? Tell him to take a wife for you too. Tell him to find a mother and a daughter for you. He'll take the uglier one and you the prettier one. His will look after you and  yours will look after him. As long as he doesn't lay hands on your wife.</p>
					<p>Son:(nodding and smiling)</p>
					<p>Son:It's so hot.</p>
					<p>Mother: In any case, his wife won't be prettier than me.</p>
					<p>Son:Marjan was prettier than you.</p>
					<p>Mother: Impossible. In any case, she won't be better than.</p>
					<p>Son:(laughing) Rubbish! If she isn't prettier, she's bound to be better.</p>
					<p>Mother: better than me? What'll make her better? Tell me.</p>
					<p>Son: You know better than I do.</p>
					<p>Mother: Give me two reasons.</p>
					<p>Son: You know better than I do. There are a thousand reasons.</p>
					<p>Mother: Does she pray?</p>
					<p>Son: No,why do you ask?</p>
					<p>Mother: I thought that maybe... No make-up allowed. No mini skirts allowed. She'll wear baggy dresses, she'll saty in all day... She'll do the dishes, cook good meals,</p>
					<p>Son: In any case, she'll be better than you.</p>
					<p>Mother: A good wife for your father</p>
					<p>Son: Better than you</p>
					<p>Mother: I get it. She'll always smell of cooking. She'll always tell to her husband, "Allright, dear. I agree and I'll obey you". True or not?</p>
					<p>Son: I'll add one thing: at least we won't have the same food every night.Even if she has all those faults, we won't eat the same thing. Tonight and tomorrow night. She won't be out all the time.</p>
					<p>Mother: I see.</p>
					<p>Son: You've talked so much and the one word convinced you!</p>
					<p> Mother: All right, I'll surrender.</p>
