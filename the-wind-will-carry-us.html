					<p>yes, lines.</p>
					<p> You mean scars?</p>
					<p>Yes, scars. They are marked during funerals. The first scar was for the death of my aunt. My poor mother did it to show her love to my father. The second was for the boss of the factory where my father worked. One of his cousins had died. So that my father wouldn't lose his job, my mother mourned a great deal, She scratched her face. I couldn't believe it. There was a lot of competition at the factory between the men to hold onto their jobs. Need and necessity, uou see? Everyone played along. There was a great deal of pressure. They all needed work. No question of showing pity or giving in, everyone displayed themselves, pushed themselves forward to please the boss. Each wanted to show that he grieved more than the others. That he was with him. That he was loyal. That kind of thing doesn't interest me. When I think about it, it's painful. Let me tell you. I think the origins of these funeral are bound to the economy. What I just told you is engraved in their memories. It has been for years and generations now. You look on it from the outside. It may interest you. But personally...</p>
